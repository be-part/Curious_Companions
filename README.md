# Curious Companions :leopard:

A front-end app utilising React, Javascript, HTML, SCSS and Axios.  

## Introduction

This project was built to develop my front-end skills; including using React, HTML, SCSS and to consider the UX.  
Users can view breeds of cats and dogs, click on an individual breed to see more in-depth information and retrieve some images and gifs of the animal in the gallery tab.  
This app uses The Cat Api: https://thecatapi.com/
